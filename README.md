# ducky-app

This App is a part of comp-it subject when I studying in the Junior year of Industrial Engineering.
Ducky is a platform that let you chat in various forums and having market place area all in one place.
This is just a pretotype app using PHP to draft all the app along.
The finish version would not be uploaded any further according to the collapse of my university's server so this is the only left over code that I could recover.

Stay tune for further ducky app version that may be more formal and more suitable for real life usage.

Thank you for your interesting.
